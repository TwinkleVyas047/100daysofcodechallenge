Day7-Use of Operators

->Objective: Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, 
find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

->Constraints: double mealCost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tipPercent: the tip percentage
int taxPercent: the tax percentage
round totalCost to the nearest integer and print the result

->Sample Input: 12.00
                20
                8
              
->Sample Output: 15
